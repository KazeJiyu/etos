# ETOS
ETOS, for Ecore TO Scala, is an [Acceleo](https://www.eclipse.org/acceleo/) project that generates Scala code from an Ecore model. More specifically, it relies on the `.genmodel` file.

# Current features
ETOS is currently able to generate:
- classes,
- traits,
- fields,
- methods.

It also handles inheritance and ScalaDoc.

# Not stable!
Since the work is still in progress, the project will change in the near future.

# Installation
As of now, the project is not mature enough to be distributed. Later, a Tycho-based build will generate the related update site.
